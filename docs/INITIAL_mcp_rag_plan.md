# Signal Hub: Implementation Plan

## High-Level Vision

Signal Hub is an intelligent developer assistant that extends Claude's context through MCP+RAG, providing seamless access to codebase knowledge while optimizing costs through smart model routing and caching. Part of the Signal ecosystem alongside Signal Box, Signal Hub serves as the central convergence point where all your code context comes together for intelligent AI routing.

## Implementation Details

### MCP Server Architecture

```python
# Core Signal Hub MCP tools to implement
tools = [
    "search_codebase",      # Semantic search across all code
    "explain_code",         # Deep explanation of code snippets
    "find_references",      # Find usages of functions/classes
    "get_context",          # Get relevant context for current work
    "escalate_query",       # Manual escalation to better model
]
```

### Codebase Indexing Strategy

**File Processing Pipeline**
1. Scan directory structure, respect .gitignore
2. Identify file types and apply appropriate parsers
3. Extract meaningful chunks (functions, classes, modules)
4. Generate embeddings for each chunk with metadata
5. Store in vector database with retrieval optimization

**Chunk Strategy**
- **Functions/Methods**: Individual functions with docstrings and signatures
- **Classes**: Class definitions with key methods
- **Modules**: File-level summaries with imports and exports
- **Documentation**: README, docstrings, and comment blocks

### Model Routing Logic

```python
def route_query(query, retrieved_context):
    complexity_score = assess_complexity(query, retrieved_context)
    
    if complexity_score < 0.3:
        return "claude-3-haiku-20240307"
    elif complexity_score < 0.7:
        return "claude-3-sonnet-20240229" 
    else:
        return "claude-3-opus-20240229"

def assess_complexity(query, context):
    factors = {
        "query_length": len(query.split()),
        "context_quality": context.quality_score,
        "reasoning_required": detect_reasoning_keywords(query),
        "code_complexity": analyze_code_complexity(context),
    }
    return weighted_complexity_score(factors)
```

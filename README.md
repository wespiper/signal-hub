# Signal Hub

> Intelligent developer assistant that extends Claude's context through MCP+RAG, providing seamless access to codebase knowledge while optimizing costs through smart model routing and caching.

## Overview

Signal Hub is part of the Signal ecosystem, serving as the central convergence point where all your code context comes together for intelligent AI routing. It acts as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives Claude unlimited effective context through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) while intelligently routing queries to the most cost-effective model.

### Key Features

- 🚀 **Unlimited Context**: Access your entire codebase through semantic search
- 💰 **Cost Optimization**: Automatic routing between Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus based on complexity
- ⚡ **Lightning Fast**: Semantic caching for instant responses to similar queries
- 🔄 **Continuous Learning**: Improves routing decisions based on user feedback
- 🛠️ **Zero Friction**: Works out of the box with minimal configuration
- 🌍 **Open Source**: Community-driven development with transparent roadmap

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Claude Code with MCP support

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/signal-hub.git
cd signal-hub
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
make dev-install
```

3. Configure Signal Hub:
```bash
cp config/example.yaml config/signal-hub.yaml
# Edit config/signal-hub.yaml with your settings
```

4. Start the MCP server:
```bash
signal-hub serve
```

5. Connect with Claude Code by adding Signal Hub to your MCP servers configuration.

## Usage

Signal Hub provides several MCP tools for intelligent code navigation:

- `search_codebase`: Semantic search across all code
- `explain_code`: Deep explanation of code snippets
- `find_references`: Find usages of functions/classes
- `get_context`: Get relevant context for current work
- `escalate_query`: Manual escalation to better model

## Architecture

Signal Hub consists of several key components:

1. **MCP Server**: Handles communication with Claude Code
2. **Indexing Pipeline**: Scans and embeds your codebase
3. **RAG System**: Retrieves relevant context for queries
4. **Model Router**: Intelligently selects the appropriate model
5. **Cache Layer**: Stores and retrieves similar queries

## Development

### Running Tests

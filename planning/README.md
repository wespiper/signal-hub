# Signal Hub Planning Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the planning and implementation documentation for Signal Hub, an intelligent MCP server that extends Claude's context through RAG while optimizing costs via smart model routing.

### 🎯 Product Strategy: Hybrid Open Source Model

#### Signal Hub Basic (Open Source - MIT License)
**Core Features:**
- ✅ MCP server integration with Claude Code
- ✅ Codebase indexing and semantic search
- ✅ Rule-based model routing (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
- ✅ Basic semantic caching
- ✅ Simple cost tracking and reporting
- ✅ ChromaDB for local vector storage
- ✅ Zero configuration setup

#### Signal Hub Pro ($29/month + 15% of savings above $100)
**Advanced Features:**
- 🚀 ML-powered model routing (70%+ cost savings)
- 🚀 Learning algorithms that improve over time
- 🚀 Detailed analytics and ROI dashboard
- 🚀 Smart semantic deduplication
- 🚀 API access for custom integrations
- 🚀 Priority support

#### Signal Hub Enterprise (Custom Pricing)
**Team & Security Features:**
- 👥 Team management and user roles
- 🔐 SSO integration (SAML/OIDC)

# Signal Hub Planning Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the planning and implementation documentation for Signal Hub, an intelligent MCP server that extends Claude's context through RAG while optimizing costs via smart model routing.

## Current Planning Structure

### Core Documents
- **[Sprint Overview](sprints/overview.md)** - High-level view of all 16 sprints across 4 phases
- **[Sprint Goals](sprints/sprint-goals.md)** - Detailed goals, deliverables, and metrics for each sprint
- **[System Architecture](architecture/system-design.md)** - Technical design and component breakdown
- **[Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md)** - Comprehensive testing approach

### Implementation Status
- **[Architecture Alignment Summary](architecture-alignment-summary.md)** - Shows how implementation aligns with design
- **[Implementation Summary](implementation-summary.md)** - Quick reference for getting started

### Sprint Tickets
- **[Sprint 1 Tickets](tickets/sprint-01/)** - âœ… Complete (10 tickets)
- **[Sprint 2 Tickets](tickets/sprint-02/)** - ðŸ”§ Enhanced with 3 additional architectural tickets

## Key Updates (Latest)

### Sprint 2 Enhancements
Based on architecture review, added critical components:
1. **Metadata Extraction** (SH-S02-011) - Enriches search with code structure
2. **Database Abstraction** (SH-S02-012) - Enables smooth production migration
3. **Batch Processing** (SH-S02-013) - 5x performance improvement

### Architecture Alignment
- All core components now have implementation tickets
- Clear path from development (ChromaDB) to production (pgvector)
- Performance optimizations scheduled appropriately

## Quick Navigation

### For Developers
1. Start with [Sprint 1 Tickets](tickets/sprint-01/README.md)
2. Review [System Architecture](architecture/system-design.md)
3. Follow [Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md)

### For Project Managers
1. Track progress via [Sprint Overview](sprints/overview.md)
2. Review [Sprint Goals](sprints/sprint-goals.md) for metrics
3. Check [Implementation Summary](implementation-summary.md) for status

### For Contributors
1. Current sprint: Sprint 1 (Core Infrastructure)
2. Next sprint: Sprint 2 (RAG Implementation - Enhanced)
3. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines

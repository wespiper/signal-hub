- ✅ ChromaDB for local vector storage
- ✅ Zero configuration setup

#### Signal Hub Pro ($29/month + 15% of savings above $100)
**Advanced Features:**
- 🚀 ML-powered model routing (70%+ cost savings)
- 🚀 Learning algorithms that improve over time
- 🚀 Detailed analytics and ROI dashboard
- 🚀 Smart semantic deduplication
- 🚀 API access for custom integrations
- 🚀 Priority support

#### Signal Hub Enterprise (Custom Pricing)
**Team & Security Features:**

# Signal Hub Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
Signal Hub is an MCP server that extends Claude's context through RAG while optimizing costs via intelligent model routing. This document summarizes the implementation plan.

## Sprint Structure

### Phase 1: Open Source Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Sprint 1**: Core Infrastructure
- 10 detailed tickets with subtasks
- Focus: MCP server, codebase scanning, embeddings
- Deliverable: Working prototype that can index code

**Sprint 2**: RAG Implementation  
- Semantic search and retrieval
- Context assembly
- Initial MCP tools

**Sprint 3**: Model Routing & Caching
- Cost optimization logic
- Semantic caching
- Manual escalation

**Sprint 4**: Polish & Launch Prep
- Documentation
- Performance optimization
- Community preparation

### Phase 2: Community & Intelligence (Weeks 5-8)
Building community and developing proprietary ML features

### Phase 3: Monetization (Weeks 9-12)
Pro tier launch with proven value proposition

### Phase 4: Enterprise & Scale (Weeks 13-16)
Enterprise features and platform expansion

## Getting Started

### For Developers:
1. Review Sprint 1 detailed tickets
2. Set up development environment (SH-008)
3. Start with SH-001 and SH-002 (foundation)
4. Follow testing strategy for all code

### For Project Managers:
1. Use sprint goals for planning
2. Track progress against success metrics
3. Adjust based on velocity

### For Contributors:
1. Check current sprint tickets
2. Follow testing requirements
3. Align with architecture decisions

## Success Criteria for Sprint 1
- [ ] MCP server connects to Claude Code
- [ ] Can scan and index a codebase
- [ ] Embeddings generated and stored
- [ ] 80% test coverage achieved
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational
- [ ] Development environment documented

## Next Steps
1. Start implementing Sprint 1 tickets
2. Set up project board for tracking
3. Schedule daily standups
4. Plan sprint review for week 4

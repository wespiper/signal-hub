# Signal Hub Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
Signal Hub is an MCP server that extends Claude's context through RAG while optimizing costs via intelligent model routing. This document summarizes the implementation plan.

### ðŸŽ¯ Hybrid Open Source Model
- **Signal Hub Basic** (MIT License): Core functionality available to all
- **Signal Hub Pro/Enterprise**: Advanced ML features for teams and organizations  
- **Early Access Program**: All features free during beta (set `SIGNAL_HUB_EARLY_ACCESS=true`)
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible design supporting both open and proprietary features

## Sprint Structure

### Phase 1: Open Source Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Sprint 1**: Core Infrastructure (ï¿½ï¸¡ Signal Hub Basic)
- 10 detailed tickets with subtasks
- Focus: MCP server, codebase scanning, embeddings
- Deliverable: Working Signal Hub Basic with plugin system
- **New**: Plugin architecture for future Pro features

**Sprint 2**: RAG Implementation  
- Semantic search and retrieval
- Context assembly
- Initial MCP tools

**Sprint 3**: Model Routing & Caching
- Cost optimization logic
- Semantic caching
- Manual escalation

**Sprint 4**: Polish & Launch Prep
- Documentation
- Performance optimization
- Community preparation

### Phase 2: Community & Intelligence (Weeks 5-8)
- Launch Signal Hub Basic to build community
- Develop ML-powered routing and analytics as plugins
- **Early Access Program**: Gather feedback on Pro features
- Measure actual cost savings to validate pricing

### Phase 3: Monetization (Weeks 9-12)
- Launch Signal Hub Pro ($29/mo + 15% of savings)
- Keep Signal Hub Basic free and open source
- Enterprise tier for large organizations

### Phase 4: Enterprise & Scale (Weeks 13-16)
Enterprise features and platform expansion

4. Follow testing strategy for all code
5. Use plugin system for new features
6. Enable early access mode for Pro features testing

### For Project Managers:
1. Use sprint goals for planning
2. Track progress against success metrics
3. Adjust based on velocity

### For Contributors:
1. Check current sprint tickets
2. Follow testing requirements
3. Align with architecture decisions

# Sprint 2: RAG Implementation Tickets

## Overview
Sprint 2 focuses on implementing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, building upon the foundation established in Sprint 1. This sprint includes both the originally planned RAG features and critical architectural components identified in the system design review.

## Sprint Goal
Implement a working semantic search system that can retrieve relevant code context, with proper abstractions for future scaling and a robust metadata system for enhanced search capabilities.

## Ticket List

### Originally Planned (from sprint-goals.md)
- **Semantic Search Implementation** - Core vector similarity search
- **Intelligent Chunking Strategies** - Language-aware code chunking
- **Context Assembly** - Coherent context building from chunks
- **MCP Tool Implementation** - search_code and explain_code tools

### Additional Critical Tickets (from architecture review)

#### P0 - Blockers
- [SH-S02-011](SH-S02-011-metadata-extraction.md) - Metadata Extraction Module (3 points)
- [SH-S02-012](SH-S02-012-database-abstraction.md) - Database Abstraction Layer (3 points)

#### P1 - High Priority
- [SH-S02-013](SH-S02-013-batch-processing.md) - Embedding Batch Processing (2 points)

## Total Additional Story Points: 8

## Dependencies
```
Sprint 1 Completion
    ├── SH-S02-011 (Metadata) ← depends on SH-S01-005 (Parsers)
    ├── SH-S02-012 (Abstraction) ← depends on SH-S01-007 (ChromaDB)
    └── SH-S02-013 (Batching) ← depends on SH-S01-006 (Embeddings)
```

## Success Metrics for Sprint 2
- [ ] Semantic search returning relevant results with >80% accuracy
- [ ] Metadata enriching search results
- [ ] Database abstraction layer operational
- [ ] 5x improvement in embedding generation throughput
- [ ] MCP tools (search_code, explain_code) working in Claude Code
- [ ] Context assembly maintaining code coherence

## Architecture Alignment
These additional tickets ensure:
1. **Complete metadata system** - Critical for intelligent search
2. **Future-proof architecture** - Abstractions for easy scaling
3. **Performance optimization** - Batch processing for efficiency
4. **Production readiness** - Foundation for migration to production systems

## Notes
- These tickets fill critical gaps identified in the architecture review
- They complement the originally planned RAG features
- Focus on building a scalable, production-ready system from the start

# Sprint 2: RAG Implementation Tickets

## Overview
Sprint 2 focuses on implementing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, building upon the foundation established in Sprint 1. This sprint delivers core semantic search functionality with intelligent chunking, context assembly, and MCP tools that make Signal Hub useful in Claude Code.

## Sprint Goal
Implement a working semantic search system that can retrieve relevant code context, with proper abstractions for future scaling and a robust metadata system for enhanced search capabilities.

# Sprint Ticket: Initial CI/CD Pipeline

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket ID**: SH-S01-010
- **Title**: Set up CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
- **Parent User Story**: Sprint 1 - Core Infrastructure
- **Priority**: P1 (High)
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Assigned To**: [DevOps Engineer]
- **Status**: To Do
- **Sprint**: Sprint 1 - Core Infrastructure
- **Epic**: Infrastructure

## Business Context
### Why This Matters
A robust CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and enables confident releases. For an open source project, this is critical for maintaining trust and encouraging contributions.

### Success Metrics
- **Performance Target**: CI runs complete in <10 minutes
- **User Impact**: Confidence in code quality
- **Business Value**: Reduced bugs, faster releases

## Description
Implement comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for testing, code quality checks, security scanning, and automated releases. Include matrix testing across Python versions and platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Functional**: All PRs automatically tested
- [ ] **Performance**: CI completes in <10 minutes
- [ ] **Quality**: Coverage reports and quality gates
- [ ] **Integration**: Automated release process

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture/Design
- GitHub Actions for all automation
- Matrix testing for Python versions
- Parallel job execution
- Caching for dependencies

### Implementation Plan
```yaml
Phase 1: Test Pipeline (Day 1)
  - Task: Basic test workflow
  - Output: Tests run on PR
  - Risk: Flaky tests

Phase 2: Quality Checks (Day 2)
  - Task: Linting and formatting
  - Output: Code quality enforced
  - Risk: Tool conflicts

Phase 3: Security & Coverage (Day 3)
  - Task: Security scanning, coverage
  - Output: Vulnerability detection
  - Risk: False positives

Phase 4: Release Pipeline (Day 4)
  - Task: Automated releases
  - Output: Tag-based releases
  - Risk: Permission issues
```

## Dependencies & Risks
### Dependencies
- **Blocking**: SH-S01-002 (Need project structure)
- **Dependent**: All future development
- **External**: GitHub Actions availability

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: CI minutes quota
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize workflows, caching
- **Risk**: Flaky tests
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Mitigation**: Retry logic, investigation

## Testing & Validation

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - [ ] PR triggers workflows
  - [ ] All checks pass
  - [ ] Release process works
  - [ ] Notifications sent
- **Automated Tests**:
  - [ ] Workflow syntax valid
  - [ ] All paths tested

### Demo Scenarios
```yaml
# Example PR with all checks
✓ test (3.11, ubuntu-latest) - 2m 15s
✓ test (3.11, macos-latest) - 2m 45s  
✓ test (3.12, ubuntu-latest) - 2m 10s
✓ lint - 45s
✓ type-check - 1m 20s
✓ security - 35s
✓ coverage - 2m 30s (85.2%)

# Release process
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
# Automatically:
# - Runs all tests
# - Builds packages
# - Publishes to PyPI
# - Creates GitHub release
# - Updates changelog
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Test workflow runs on all PRs
- [ ] Python 3.11 and 3.12 tested
- [ ] Code quality checks enforced
- [ ] Security scanning active
- [ ] Coverage reporting working
- [ ] Release automation tested
- [ ] Dependency updates configured
- [ ] All workflows < 10 minutes
- [ ] Documentation updated

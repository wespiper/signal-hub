# Sprint Ticket: Development Environment Setup

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket ID**: SH-S01-008
- **Title**: Create Development Environment Setup
- **Parent User Story**: Sprint 1 - Core Infrastructure
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium)
- **Story Points**: 2
- **Assigned To**: [DevOps Engineer]
- **Status**: To Do
- **Sprint**: Sprint 1 - Core Infrastructure
- **Epic**: Infrastructure

## Business Context
### Why This Matters
A smooth development environment setup is crucial for contributor onboarding. The easier it is to get started, the more likely we are to attract and retain open source contributors.

### Success Metrics
- **Performance Target**: Full setup in <5 minutes
- **User Impact**: New developers productive immediately
- **Business Value**: Increased contributor engagement

## Description
Create a comprehensive development environment setup including Docker Compose for services, environment configuration, setup scripts, and clear documentation. Should work on Mac, Linux, and Windows (WSL2).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Functional**: One-command development environment setup
- [ ] **Performance**: Setup completes in <5 minutes
- [ ] **Quality**: Works across all major platforms
- [ ] **Integration**: All services properly connected

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture/Design
- Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Environment variable management
- Platform-specific setup scripts
- Health checks for all services

### Implementation Plan
```yaml
Phase 1: Docker Setup (Hours 1-2)
  - Task: Create docker-compose.yml
  - Output: Services runnable
  - Risk: Platform differences

Phase 2: Environment Config (Hours 3-4)
  - Task: Environment templates
  - Output: Easy configuration
  - Risk: Missing variables

Phase 3: Setup Scripts (Hours 5-6)
  - Task: Automation scripts
  - Output: One-command setup
  - Risk: Permission issues

Phase 4: Documentation (Hours 7-8)
  - Task: Setup guide
  - Output: Clear instructions
  - Risk: Assumptions
```

- **Dependent**: All development work
- **External**: Docker, Python

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Docker not installed
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Installation instructions
- **Risk**: Port conflicts
  - **Impact**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Configurable ports

## Testing & Validation

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - [ ] Fresh setup on Mac
  - [ ] Fresh setup on Linux
  - [ ] Fresh setup on Windows
  - [ ] Service connectivity
- **Automated Tests**:
  - [ ] Environment validation
  - [ ] Service health checks

### Demo Scenarios
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/signal-hub/signal-hub
cd signal-hub

# One-command setup
./scripts/setup.sh

# Verify everything is running
./scripts/validate.sh
✓ Python 3.11+ installed
✓ Poetry installed
✓ Docker running
✓ ChromaDB accessible
✓ Redis accessible
✓ Signal Hub server running

# Start developing!
make test
```

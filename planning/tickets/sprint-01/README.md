# Sprint 1: Core Infrastructure Tickets

## Overview
This directory contains all tickets for Sprint 1, which focuses on establishing the core infrastructure for Signal Hub.

## Sprint Goal
Establish a solid foundation with a working MCP server that can connect to Claude Code, scan codebases, and generate embeddings stored in ChromaDB.

## Notes
- Start with SH-S01-001 and SH-S01-002 in parallel
- SH-S01-003 (MCP Server) is the critical path blocker
- SH-S01-008 can be worked on independently
- Aim to have basic demo working by end of sprint

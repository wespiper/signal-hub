## Technical Implementation

### Architecture/Design
- Public GitHub repository under organization account
- Branch protection rules for main branch
- Issue and PR templates for consistency
- Community health files in root directory

### Implementation Plan
```yaml
Phase 1: Repository Creation (Hour 1-2)
  - Task: Create GitHub repository
  - Output: Public repository accessible
  - Risk: None

Phase 2: Configuration (Hour 3-4)
  - Task: Configure settings and branch protection
  - Output: Repository secured
  - Risk: Over-restrictive settings

Phase 3: Community Files (Hour 5-6)

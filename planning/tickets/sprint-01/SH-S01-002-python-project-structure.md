# Sprint Ticket: Python Project Structure

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket ID**: SH-S01-002
- **Title**: Initialize Python Project with Modern Tooling
- **Parent User Story**: Sprint 1 - Core Infrastructure
- **Priority**: P0 (Blocker)
- **Story Points**: 3 (increased due to plugin architecture)
- **Assigned To**: [Backend Engineer]
- **Status**: ✅ Partially Complete
- **Sprint**: Sprint 1 - Core Infrastructure
- **Epic**: Infrastructure

## Business Context
### Why This Matters
A well-structured Python project with modern tooling ensures code quality, developer productivity, and maintainability. This sets the standard for all future development.

### Success Metrics
- **Performance Target**: Dev environment setup in <5 minutes
- **User Impact**: Consistent development experience across contributors
- **Business Value**: Reduced onboarding time and fewer bugs

## Description
Set up a modern Python project structure using Poetry for dependency management, with comprehensive tooling for code quality including linting, formatting, type checking, and pre-commit hooks. Must include plugin architecture for Signal Hub Basic/Pro/Enterprise edition support.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **Functional**: Poetry-based project with all dependencies installable
- [ ] **Performance**: Installation completes in <2 minutes
- [ ] **Quality**: All quality tools configured and working
- [ ] **Integration**: Pre-commit hooks catch issues before commit
- [x] **Plugin Architecture**: Plugin system implemented for Pro features
- [x] **Feature Flags**: Edition-based feature management implemented

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture/Design
- Poetry for dependency management (better than pip)
- Pyproject.toml as single source of truth
- Separate dev and prod dependencies
- Pre-commit hooks for quality enforcement
- **Plugin architecture** for Signal Hub Basic/Pro/Enterprise
- **Feature flags** for edition-based functionality
- **Early access mode** support

### Implementation Plan
```yaml
Phase 1: Project Initialization (Hour 1)
  - Task: Initialize Poetry project
  - Output: Basic pyproject.toml created
  - Risk: None

Phase 2: Dependency Setup (Hour 2)
  - Task: Add all required dependencies
  - Output: Dependencies installable
  - Risk: Version conflicts

Phase 3: Quality Tools (Hour 3-4)
  - Task: Configure linting, formatting, type checking
  - Output: Pre-commit hooks working
  - Risk: Tool conflicts
```

### Code Structure
```

│   └── signal_hub/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── __main__.py

```

## Dependencies & Risks
### Dependencies
- **Blocking**: SH-S01-001 (Repository must exist)
- **Dependent**: All Python development tickets
- **External**: PyPI availability

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Poetry not installed on developer machines
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Provide installation instructions
- **Risk**: Dependency version conflicts
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Mitigation**: Pin all dependency versions

## Testing & Validation

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - [ ] Fresh clone and install works
  - [ ] All make commands function
  - [ ] Pre-commit hooks trigger
  - [ ] Tests can be run
- **Automated Tests**:
  - [ ] CI validates project structure
  - [ ] Dependency security scanning

### Demo Scenarios
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone repo && cd signal-hub
poetry install

# Verify tooling
make lint
make format
make test
make type-check

# Verify pre-commit
git add . && git commit -m "test"
# Should see hooks running
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Poetry project initialized with pyproject.toml
- [ ] All dependencies specified and installable
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks configured and working
- [ ] Makefile with common commands
- [ ] Development tools working (black, ruff, mypy)
- [ ] Test structure created
- [ ] Environment setup documented
- [ ] .python-version specified
- [ ] CI can install and run tests

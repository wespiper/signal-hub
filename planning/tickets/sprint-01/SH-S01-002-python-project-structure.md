# Sprint Ticket: Python Project Structure

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket ID**: SH-S01-002
- **Title**: Initialize Python Project with Modern Tooling
- **Parent User Story**: Sprint 1 - Core Infrastructure
- **Priority**: P0 (Blocker)
- **Story Points**: 3 (increased due to plugin architecture)
- **Assigned To**: [Backend Engineer]
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Sprint**: Sprint 1 - Core Infrastructure
- **Epic**: Infrastructure

## Business Context
### Why This Matters
A well-structured Python project with modern tooling ensures code quality, developer productivity, and maintainability. This sets the standard for all future development.

### Success Metrics
- **Performance Target**: Dev environment setup in <5 minutes
- **User Impact**: Consistent development experience across contributors
- **Business Value**: Reduced onboarding time and fewer bugs

## Description
Set up a modern Python project structure using Poetry for dependency management, with comprehensive tooling for code quality including linting, formatting, type checking, and pre-commit hooks. Must include plugin architecture for Signal Hub Basic/Pro/Enterprise edition support.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **Functional**: Poetry-based project with all dependencies installable
- [x] **Performance**: Installation completes in <2 minutes
- [x] **Quality**: All quality tools configured and working
- [x] **Integration**: Pre-commit hooks catch issues before commit
- [x] **Plugin Architecture**: Plugin system implemented for Pro features
- [x] **Feature Flags**: Edition-based feature management implemented

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture/Design
- Poetry for dependency management (better than pip)
- Pyproject.toml as single source of truth
- Separate dev and prod dependencies
- Pre-commit hooks for quality enforcement
- **Plugin architecture** for Signal Hub Basic/Pro/Enterprise
- **Feature flags** for edition-based functionality
- **Early access mode** support

### Implementation Plan
```yaml
Phase 1: Project Initialization (Hour 1)
  - Task: Initialize Poetry project
  - Output: Basic pyproject.toml created
  - Risk: None

Phase 2: Dependency Setup (Hour 2)
  - Task: Add all required dependencies
  - Output: Dependencies installable
  - Risk: Version conflicts

Phase 3: Quality Tools (Hour 3-4)
  - Task: Configure linting, formatting, type checking
  - Output: Pre-commit hooks working
  - Risk: Tool conflicts
```

### Code Structure
```

```

## Dependencies & Risks
### Dependencies
- **Blocking**: SH-S01-001 (Repository must exist)
- **Dependent**: All Python development tickets
- **External**: PyPI availability

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Poetry not installed on developer machines
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Provide installation instructions
- **Risk**: Dependency version conflicts
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Mitigation**: Pin all dependency versions

## Testing & Validation

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - [x] Fresh clone and install works
  - [x] All make commands function
  - [x] Pre-commit hooks trigger
  - [x] Tests can be run
- **Automated Tests**:
  - [x] CI validates project structure
  - [x] Dependency security scanning

### Demo Scenarios
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone repo && cd signal-hub
poetry install

# Verify tooling
make lint
make format
make test
make type-check

# Verify pre-commit
git add . && git commit -m "test"
# Should see hooks running
```

## Definition of Done
- [x] Poetry project initialized with pyproject.toml ✅
- [x] All dependencies specified and installable ✅
- [x] Pre-commit hooks configured and working ✅
- [x] Makefile with common commands ✅
- [x] Development tools working (black, ruff, mypy) ✅
- [x] Test structure created ✅
- [x] Environment setup documented ✅
- [x] .python-version specified ✅
- [x] CI can install and run tests ✅

## Additional Deliverables Completed
- [x] **Enhanced pre-commit hooks**: Added security scanning (bandit), poetry checks
- [x] **Comprehensive Makefile**: Added serve, serve-pro, check, and build commands
- [x] **Test fixtures**: Created conftest.py with edition-aware fixtures
- [x] **CLI interface**: Basic CLI with version, serve, and config commands
- [x] **.env.example**: Comprehensive environment configuration template
- [x] **Project structure**: All directories created with proper __init__.py files

## Notes & Resources
- **Design Docs**: [Python Best Practices](https://docs.python-guide.org/)
- **Partner Context**: Standard structure for Python MCP servers
- **Future Considerations**: May need to add more tools as project grows
- **Learning Resources**: [Poetry Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- **Implementation Date**: Completed on 2025-06-15

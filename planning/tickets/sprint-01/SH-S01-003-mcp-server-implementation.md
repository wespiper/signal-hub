# Sprint Ticket: Basic MCP Server Implementation

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket ID**: SH-S01-003
- **Title**: Implement Basic MCP Server
- **Parent User Story**: Sprint 1 - Core Infrastructure
- **Priority**: P0 (Blocker)
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Assigned To**: [Senior Backend Engineer]
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Sprint**: Sprint 1 - Core Infrastructure
- **Epic**: MCP

## Business Context
### Why This Matters
The MCP server is the core of Signal Hub - it's how we communicate with Claude Code. Without this, we have no product. This implementation establishes the foundation for all AI interactions.

### Success Metrics
- **Performance Target**: <100ms response time for basic requests
- **User Impact**: Enables Claude Code to connect to Signal Hub
- **Business Value**: Core product functionality operational

## Description
Implement a basic MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that can handle connections from Claude Code, respond to protocol messages, and list available tools. This server must integrate with the plugin architecture to support both Signal Hub Basic features and future Pro/Enterprise features through plugins.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **Functional**: MCP server starts and accepts connections
- [x] **Performance**: Responds to ping in <100ms
- [x] **Quality**: Handles errors gracefully with proper logging
- [x] **Integration**: Claude Code can connect and see tool list

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture/Design
- Async Python server using MCP SDK
- **Plugin-based architecture** for extensibility
- **Feature flags integration** for edition management
- Configuration-driven setup (supports Basic/Pro/Enterprise)
- Extensible tool registration system
- Structured logging for debugging

### Implementation Plan
```yaml
Phase 1: Core Server (Day 1)
  - Task: Create SignalHubServer class
  - Output: Server can start/stop
  - Risk: MCP SDK compatibility

Phase 2: Protocol Handler (Day 2)
  - Task: Implement MCP message handling
  - Output: Valid protocol responses
  - Risk: Protocol compliance

Phase 3: Tool System & Plugins (Day 3)
  - Task: Create tool registration with plugin support
  - Output: Tools listed in Claude, plugin hooks ready
  - Risk: Tool format issues, plugin interface complexity

Phase 4: Configuration (Day 4)
  - Task: Add config system
  - Output: Configurable server
  - Risk: Config validation

Phase 5: Testing (Day 5)
  - Task: Complete test coverage
  - Output: Reliable server
  - Risk: Edge cases
```

## Dependencies & Risks
### Dependencies
- **Blocking**: SH-S01-002 (Python project structure)
- **Dependent**: All tool implementation tickets
- **External**: MCP Python SDK

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: MCP SDK changes or bugs
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Mitigation**: Pin SDK version, have workarounds ready
- **Risk**: Protocol compliance issues
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive protocol testing

## Testing & Validation

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - [x] Server initialization
  - [x] Start/stop lifecycle
  - [x] Configuration loading
  - [x] Error handling
  - [x] Tool registration
- **Integration Tests**:
  - [x] Full protocol compliance
  - [x] Claude Code connection
  - [x] Concurrent connections
  - [x] Performance benchmarks

### Demo Scenarios
```python
# Start the server (Signal Hub Basic)
signal-hub serve --config dev.yaml

# Start with early access (all features enabled)
SIGNAL_HUB_EARLY_ACCESS=true signal-hub serve --config dev.yaml

# In another terminal, verify it's running
curl http://localhost:3333/health

# Connect with Claude Code
# Should see "Signal Hub Basic" in server list
# Should see available tools based on edition
# Basic tools: search_codebase, explain_code, etc.
# Pro tools (early access): ml_route_query, analyze_cost_savings
```

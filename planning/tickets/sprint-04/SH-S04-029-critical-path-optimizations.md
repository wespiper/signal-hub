## Technical Design

### Optimization Areas

#### 1. Search Optimization
```python
# Current: Sequential processing
results = []
for chunk in chunks:
    score = calculate_similarity(query_embedding, chunk.embedding)
    if score > threshold:
        results.append((chunk, score))

# Optimized: Batch processing with NumPy
chunk_embeddings = np.array([c.embedding for c in chunks])
scores = np.dot(query_embedding, chunk_embeddings.T)
mask = scores > threshold
results = [(chunks[i], scores[i]) for i in np.where(mask)[0]]
```

#### 2. Indexing Optimization
```python
# Current: Individual file processing
for file in files:
    content = read_file(file)
    chunks = chunk_content(content)
    embeddings = generate_embeddings(chunks)
    store_embeddings(embeddings)

# Optimized: Batch processing with async I/O
async def process_batch(files_batch):
    # Parallel file reading
    contents = await asyncio.gather(*[
        read_file_async(f) for f in files_batch
    ])
    
    # Batch chunking
    all_chunks = []
    for content in contents:
        all_chunks.extend(chunk_content(content))
    
    # Batch embedding generation
    embeddings = await generate_embeddings_batch(all_chunks)
    
    # Bulk storage
    await store_embeddings_bulk(embeddings)
```

#### 3. Cache Optimization
```python
# Current: Linear search for similar queries
def find_similar(query: str, cache: List[CacheEntry]):
    for entry in cache:
        if similarity(query, entry.query) > threshold:
            return entry.response
    return None

# Optimized: LSH for approximate nearest neighbor
class OptimizedCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lsh = LSHIndex(hash_size=256, num_tables=10)
        
    def find_similar(self, query: str):
        query_hash = self.lsh.hash(query)
        candidates = self.lsh.query(query_hash, k=10)
        
        # Only compute similarity for candidates
        for candidate in candidates:
            if similarity(query, candidate.query) > threshold:
                return candidate.response
        return None
```

## Optimization Targets
| Component | Current | Target | Method |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Search Latency | 2.5s | 1.5s | Batch operations, caching |
| Indexing Speed | 800 files/min | 1200 files/min | Async I/O, batching |
| Cache Hit Rate | 35% | 50% | Better similarity algorithm |
| Memory Usage | 1.2GB | 900MB | Efficient data structures |
| Routing Decision | 10ms | 1ms | Caching, rule optimization |

## Testing Strategy
1. **Micro-benchmarks**: Test individual optimizations
2. **Integration Tests**: Ensure functionality preserved
3. **Load Testing**: Validate under stress
4. **A/B Testing**: Compare implementations

## Risks & Mitigations

# Sprint 3: Model Routing & Caching Tickets

## Overview
Sprint 3 focuses on implementing cost optimization features through intelligent model routing and semantic caching. This sprint delivers the core value proposition of Signal Hub Basic: reducing AI costs while maintaining quality through smart routing between Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus models.

## Sprint Goal
Implement simple but effective rule-based model routing and semantic caching to achieve 30-40% cost reduction compared to always using Opus, while maintaining user control through manual escalation.

## Success Metrics for Sprint 3
- **Cost Reduction**: 30-40% vs always using Opus
- **Routing Accuracy**: >90% appropriate model selection
- **Cache Performance**: >40% hit rate, <50ms lookup time
- **User Control**: <10% manual escalation rate
- **Security**: All API endpoints protected
- **Configuration**: <5 minutes to customize routing rules

## Architecture Alignment
This sprint delivers:
1. **Cost Optimization** - Core value prop of Signal Hub
2. **User Control** - Manual escalation for important queries
3. **Performance** - Fast routing decisions and cache hits
4. **Security** - Production-ready API protection
5. **Plugin Hooks** - For future ML-powered routing (Pro)

## Implementation Order
Recommended implementation sequence:
1. **Week 1**: SH-S03-018 (Routing), SH-S03-023 (Configuration)
2. **Week 2**: SH-S03-019 (Cache), SH-S03-020 (Cost Tracking)
3. **Week 3**: SH-S03-021 (Escalation), SH-S03-022 (Cache Mgmt), SH-S03-024 (Security)

## Plugin Architecture Considerations
While implementing Basic edition features, ensure:
- Routing engine has clear interfaces for ML plugins
- Cost tracking can support advanced analytics
- Cache system can integrate with Pro deduplication
- Configuration supports feature flags for Pro features

## Notes
- Focus on simplicity and effectiveness over complexity
- Ensure zero-configuration works well for most users
- Document all routing rules clearly
- Consider Pro edition hooks but don't over-engineer
- Security is critical for production readiness

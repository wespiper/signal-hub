# SH-S03-022: Cache Management & Eviction

## Summary
Implement comprehensive cache management including eviction strategies, size limits, and management tools to ensure the semantic cache remains performant and effective over time.

## Background
As the semantic cache grows, it needs intelligent management to maintain performance. This ticket implements eviction strategies, size management, and tools for users to manage their cache effectively.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Eviction Strategies**
   - TTL (Time-To-Live) based eviction
   - LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
   - Quality-based eviction (low-quality responses)
   - Size-based limits (max entries/memory)

2. **Cache Management API**
   - Clear entire cache
   - Clear by pattern/context
   - View cache statistics
   - Manual entry removal
   - Cache export/import

3. **Automatic Maintenance**
   - Background eviction process
   - Cache compaction
   - Index optimization
   - Health monitoring

4. **Configuration**
   - Configurable cache size limits
   - Adjustable TTL values
   - Strategy selection
   - Performance tuning

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Eviction overhead <5% of cache operations
- No blocking during maintenance
- Graceful degradation when full
- Consistent performance characteristics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TTL eviction working correctly
- [ ] LRU eviction implemented
- [ ] Size limits enforced
- [ ] Management API functional
- [ ] Background maintenance running
- [ ] Cache stays within configured limits
- [ ] Performance remains consistent
- [ ] Unit tests with >90% coverage
- [ ] Load tests with cache pressure

### Eviction Algorithm
```python
class CacheManager:
    async def evict(self):
        """Run eviction strategies in order."""
        # 1. Remove expired entries (TTL)
        expired = await self.evict_expired()
        
        # 2. Check size limits
        if await self.is_over_limit():
            # 3. Remove low-quality entries
            removed = await self.evict_low_quality()
            
            # 4. If still over, use LRU
            if await self.is_over_limit():
                await self.evict_lru()
                
        # 5. Optimize storage
        await self.compact()
```

### Management API
```python
class CacheManagementAPI:
    async def clear_all(self) -> int:
        """Clear entire cache."""
        
    async def clear_pattern(self, pattern: str) -> int:
        """Clear entries matching pattern."""
        
    async def get_stats(self) -> CacheStats:
        """Get cache statistics."""
        
    async def export_cache(self, format: str) -> bytes:
        """Export cache data."""
        
    async def import_cache(self, data: bytes) -> int:
        """Import cache data."""
```

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Implement TTL eviction strategy
- [ ] Implement LRU eviction strategy
- [ ] Implement quality-based eviction
- [ ] Build composite eviction system
- [ ] Create background maintenance
- [ ] Implement management API
- [ ] Add cache monitoring
- [ ] Create management tools
- [ ] Build cache statistics

## Dependencies
- Semantic cache (SH-S03-019)
- Storage system (Sprint 1)
- Metrics system (Sprint 1)

## Configuration
```yaml
cache:
  management:
    max_entries: 10000
    max_size_mb: 1000
    ttl_hours: 24
    eviction_strategies:
      - ttl
      - quality
      - lru
    maintenance_interval: 3600  # seconds
    compact_threshold: 0.7      # 70% fragmentation
```

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Each eviction strategy
2. **Integration Tests**: Full eviction flow
3. **Load Tests**: Cache under pressure
4. **Performance Tests**: Eviction overhead

## Monitoring Metrics
- Cache size (entries and memory)
- Eviction rate by strategy
- Cache fragmentation
- Maintenance duration
- Hit rate over time

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Eviction causing performance spikes
  - **Mitigation**: Incremental eviction, off-peak scheduling
- **Risk**: Important entries evicted
  - **Mitigation**: Quality scoring, pinning capability
- **Risk**: Cache corruption during maintenance
  - **Mitigation**: Atomic operations, backups

## Success Metrics
- Cache stays within size limits
- <5% performance overhead
- No user-visible delays
- Consistent hit rates

## Notes
- Design for Pro edition advanced eviction
- Consider cache warming strategies
- Monitor eviction patterns
- Provide clear management tools

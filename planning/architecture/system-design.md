# Signal Hub System Architecture

## Overview
Signal Hub is an MCP server that provides intelligent context retrieval and model routing for Claude Code, optimizing costs while maintaining quality.

### ðŸŽ¯ Hybrid Open Source Model
- **Signal Hub Basic** (Open Source): Core MCP functionality with basic routing and caching
- **Signal Hub Pro/Enterprise**: Advanced ML-powered features via plugin architecture
- **Plugin System**: Extensible design allowing Pro features to be added without modifying core

## Core Components

### 0. Plugin Architecture (NEW)
- **Plugin Manager**: Loads and manages plugin lifecycle
- **Plugin Interfaces**: ModelRouter, CacheStrategy, AnalyticsProvider
- **Feature Flags**: Edition-based feature availability
- **Plugin Registry**: Discovers and registers available plugins

### 1. MCP Server Layer
- **SignalHubServer**: Main server class handling MCP protocol
- **Tool Registry**: Manages available MCP tools
- **Request Handler**: Processes incoming tool requests
- **Response Builder**: Formats responses for Claude Code

### 2. Indexing Pipeline
- **Code Scanner**: Traverses and discovers files
- **File Parsers**: Language-specific parsing logic
- **Chunk Generator**: Creates semantic chunks from code
- **Embedding Service**: Generates vector embeddings
- **Metadata Extractor**: Captures file and code metadata

### 3. Retrieval System
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB for development, pgvector for production
- **Similarity Search**: Finds relevant code chunks
- **Context Assembly**: Builds coherent context from chunks
- **Ranking Engine**: Orders results by relevance

### 4. Model Routing (Plugin-Based)
- **Basic Router** (Signal Hub Basic): Rule-based model selection
- **ML Router** (Pro Plugin): ML-powered complexity assessment
- **Routing Engine**: Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
- **Cost Tracker**: Monitors token usage and costs
- **Escalation Handler**: Manages manual model upgrades

### 5. Caching Layer (Plugin-Based)
- **Basic Cache** (Signal Hub Basic): Simple semantic caching
- **Advanced Cache** (Pro Plugin): ML-optimized caching strategies
- **Cache Manager**: Plugin-based cache strategy selection
- **Performance Monitor**: Tracks cache hit rates

## Data Flow

```
1. User Query â†’ MCP Server
2. MCP Server â†’ Complexity Assessment
3. Parallel:
   a. Vector Search â†’ Retrieve Context
   b. Cache Lookup â†’ Check for Similar Queries
4. Context Assembly â†’ Rank and Filter
5. Model Selection â†’ Route to Appropriate Model
6. Generate Response â†’ Cache Result
7. Return to User via MCP
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Modularity
- **NEW**: Plugin architecture for all major components
- **NEW**: Feature flags for edition-based functionality
- Plugin architecture for parsers and embedders
- Swappable vector stores and cache backends
- Extensible tool system
- **NEW**: Clear separation between Basic and Pro features

### Performance
- Async/await for concurrent operations
- Batch processing for embeddings
- Lazy loading of large files
- Connection pooling for databases

### Scalability
- Stateless server design
- Horizontal scaling support
- Distributed caching capability
- Queue-based indexing for large codebases

### Security
- Sandboxed code execution
- API key management
- Rate limiting per user/project
- Audit logging for enterprise
- **NEW**: License key validation for Pro features
- **NEW**: Feature access control based on edition

## Technology Choices

### Core Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Framework**: MCP Python SDK
- **Async**: asyncio with aiohttp
- **Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio

### Data Storage
- **Vectors**: ChromaDB (dev), PostgreSQL + pgvector (prod)
- **Cache**: SQLite (dev), Redis (prod)
- **Config**: YAML files with environment overrides
- **Metrics**: Prometheus format

### External Services
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI API with local fallback
- **Models**: Anthropic API
- **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry compatible
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies with Poetry
3. Run docker-compose for services
4. Start MCP server in development mode
5. Connect with Claude Code

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all core modules
- Integration tests for MCP protocol
- End-to-end tests with mock Claude Code
- Performance benchmarks for routing decisions
- Load tests for concurrent users

### Deployment
- Docker containers for all services
- Kubernetes manifests for production
- Helm charts for enterprise deployment
- Terraform modules for cloud resources
